AYUSH/E/2019/00336  ,Siub : Complaint against Mis behavior by Mr Jagdeep at CGHS Kingsway CampDear SirThis my *nd complaint regarding gross inefficiency and unacceptable rude behaviors of staff at CGHS dispensary Kingsway Camp. On my *st complaint made to CGHS Director no action was taken   hence staff is at their full zeal to keep on threatening  misbehaving with public at large*. Today morning I approached the registration counter for taking appointment about my son and myself for Ayurveda consultation. The person on duty was Jagdeep. *. I was carrying color print out of online cards available at CGHS website which clearly mentioned that these cards are acceptable  ( I have recently lost my cards so due to urgency i took print out of card and presented at the counter) *. Jagdeep refused to accept these cards and threw it back to me stating that these are not acceptable and on explaining him the situation he said  You could be  fraudster .. he asked me to explain who signed these cards.. why he should accept this. I explained him the website remarks on which he started mis behaving and said  GO TO THE CGHS DIRECTOR WHO SIGNED THESE CRDS AND ASK HIM TO CALL ME ...ASK HIM TO GIVE ME SCANNER *ST USING WHICH I CAN READ  UR  ON CARD ETE ETC .  His tone and words were humiliating .  He even said take my name  Jagdeep  and do complaint to HO..I know how to manage them  . .......i kept on saying that my son is not well and he should accept these cards but he kept on  behaving arrogantly  mis behaved in front of public who was in line . Finally after repeated round of request he accepted but commented   you are a fraudster and threw back cards to me *.  I brought the incident to knowledge of CMO Mrs Bali  who just said   ill look into the matter .  I was expecting at least she should have taken some action or even summoned the concerned person but nothing happened. It seems that we are at mercy of CGHS staff and the way they behave is something which is beyond comprehension . We are not paying for the facility to face such things from the staff... I immediate demand action on my complaint and strict action should be initiated against the erring staff mentioned in my complaint. How can public servant use such humiliating  derogating remarks against public and can ignore his official duties.  Also I demand detailed report on my *st complaint and what action was taken against erring staff at that time It seems until unless CGHS HO department take concrete action these episodes would continue to happen,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,31-05-19,CGHS Delhi,CGHS Office East Zone,  Please look into the matter.,12

AYUSH/E/2019/00338  ,Dear Sir I would like to draw your kind attention towards CURSE being born by BAMS degree holders (prior to **** batch) of Delhi University. Criteria to get first division in all courses in entire country is ** percent while it is ** percent only in case of BAMS degree holders from Delhi University. So person who got even above ** percent is considered as second division (copy attached). After **** amendment this criteria for getting first division has been revised but only for those who are passing out after **** (copy attached). So those who passed out before **** are still bearing the pain as in many recruitment processes first degree plays an important role which can be seen in Delhi University adhoc panel recruitment (copy attached).Secondly BAMS degree does not come under any classification viz Science Commerce Arts Medicine Engineering etc. I hope you will look into the matter as persons from same college and same university cannot have different divisions for same marks.

AYUSH/E/2019/00486  ,Respected Minister of the concerned department  I want to discuss with you the INEQUALITIES FACED BY FEMALE DEFENCE ASPIRANTS IN THE SELECTION PROCESS I m SURBHI SHARMA  one of the defence aspirants from Pathankot Punjab. I have a sorted dream of joining Indian Army for Officer Entry. I appeared for CDS examination conducted by UPSC cleared it got recommended from SSB and was declared medically fit. I have cleared the Exam SSB and the Medical criteria from **SSB Allahbad **** June Inspite of scoring AIR ** I am not able to go to OTA due to less number of vacancies for females. Service Selection Board recommends a candidate since he/she possess all the qualities to become an Army officer and can serve the nation in the best possible way however its the female candidates who are restricted by the LESS NUMBER OF VACANCIES FOR WOMEN CDS ENTRY i.e ** as compared to that of Men vacancies i.e ***. The ratio of ***:** is the issue which has to be looked upon. Sirtoday the Govt of India in all aspects talks of EQUALITYBETI BACHAO - BETI PADHAO and efforts beings made to empower girls but this seems unreal for us because looking at the ratio of ***:** we feel our capabilities and potentials are not even treated equally. We all Men and Women appear for the same CDS examclears the same SSB interview and undergo same medical procedure but when it comes to selection we are  given a tag of MERIT OUT and that too after we see our names in the same merit list of men because in our case only ** girls go to the academy whereas in men case around **-*** seats remain vacant every year and when we ask a reason for this unjust treatment we are  often sympathised by saying girls cant be in Combat roles  sir then why we see girls serving on borders in Central Armed Police ForceBSFthey are posted in naxal affected areas also.And if not the combat roles WE CAN FILL THE GAPS OF LEFT OVER VACANCIES OF MEN CDS ENTRY taking over administrative posts. The women of today have all the potentials and abilities to stand and compete equally with men but if the system itself is not letting us then sorry to say sir we are already failed much before we think of dreaming something big. I dont know how to console myself and my parents in this situation as I never have failed at any level in this process. The boys get a number of opportunities after their schooling like NDA then IMA OTA but we girls only get one entry i.e OTA and that too not really in favour. Not asking for sympathyjust asking for  If there is Equal criteria equal obligations then why are the OUTCOMES UNEQUAL  Sirwhy are we girls of today being encouraged to keep passion towards this service when we are let down everytime by the system itself whenever we come upto the expectations of it. SirI m folding my hands and requesting you that we have not failed at any level in this process please dont let the system fail us due to GENDER INEQUALITY.I humbly request you to take all the girls who are in the merit this time who are medically fit and give us a true example of Women Empowerment.We see many lady officers leading the whole regiment on Republic day parades is where we see ourselves one day so that we can also inspire the coming generation. We know the value of this servicethe integritythe level of loyalty and Dedication it needswe are readyWE ARE READY TO SERVE THE NATION in all kind of terrain. Today in this erawhenever any common citizen of India face any problemwe often hear such words MODI JI KO BOLO WO PAKKA KUCH KRENGE  Sirwe are looking at your with hopeful eyes and our issue be resolved.

AYUSH/E/2019/00560  ,I am CGHS beneficiary & my Beneficiary Id is S-****** .  My mother is suffering from a lung related disease (Pulmonary Edema) & under treatment at CGHS empanelled hospital Primus Super specialty Hospital-Chankyapuri. On dated **/**/**** while she was taking consultation with the treating doctor she fainted down  & having chest pain & short breathlessness . The treating doctor immediately sent to the emergency of the same hospital where vitals were checked (BP-***/***SiO*-** percent).Seeing the seriousness of my mothers condition the doctor in emergency  immediately admitted her in cardiac care unit (CCU) in emergency &  mentioned complaint of ACS/ DOE/ Ped edema  in emergency certificate. In CCU unit my mother was administered medicine for hypertension & possible heart problem related . In addition to this some pathological test (CBCLFTKFT etc) & radio-logical test (X-Ray chest & *D echo)  in CCU was also carried out. The senior cardiologist of the hospital also suggested for coronary angiography  on  the next day (i.e. dated **/**/****). The angiography confirmed blockage in lung arteries & of non CAD type hence advised not to perform angioplasty  due to her old age (** Years) & advised to kept her on medicine to desolve the mild blockage.

But the dealing assistant  passed the reimbursement amount only half of the claimed amount . When I asked the reason the dealing assistant told me that the reimbursed amount is restricted to only the package charge of coronary angiography. In this regard I humbly request you to issue a clarification whether an impatient  under indoor treatment in emergency is only eligible for the digonestic test  coronary angiography & other expenditure like CCU chargesadmission charges other pathological /radio logical chargesdiet charges being an indoor patient under emergency treatment is not admissible. Also clarify that if any patient admitted in emergency & if she is being discharged suppose one or two week  after the date of admission then the patient is reimbursed only the package rate of angiography & other charges is to beard by the patient itself.

CBODT/E/2019/07169  ,The assessing officer has closed the grievance  matter in an unjustifiable manner.  Prior to CPGRAM  the AO has not responded to any rectification request of the assessee. The first letter dated **th may **** requesting the issue of refund was  filed with the Assessing Officer on **/**/ **** . Till the submission of said letter the assessee has not received any intimation or any refund for the said year. Your honor may also observe from the subject of the letter  - Request To Issue  Refund .  After filing the letter the assessee followed up with AO and his inspector for the first time shared the online computation working u/s ***(*)  in the month of June ****  showing  non credit of TDS of Rs. ***** /- and refund of Rs.*****. This was not an intimation u/s ***(*)(a) but online computation sheet. However relying on the said computation assessee filed its first rectification request wide letter dated **/**/ ****  flied on **/**/ ****. The subject of the letter was -Rectification Of Mistake U/S ***. The said rectification was within  * years  after receipt of computation sheet in June ****. The said rectification request was carrying all the requisites documents for grant of TDS credit including  form **A. The assessee again on **/**/****  through letter dated **/**/ ****  filed indemnity bond for credit of TDS. Thereafter  assessee again filed follow up letter for rectification on **/**/**** **/**/**** and **/**/**** wide letter dated **/**/**** */**/**** and  **/**/**** respectively. Irrespective of filing so many letters  till the date of filing the CPGRAM no response has been  received from the learned AO. Being thus aggrieved the asseessee filed the Grievance which was immediately rejected by the AO on the ground that the rectification is time barred and the grievance filed is misleading. In response to this the assessee submits that for calculating the period of * years date of receipt is to be considered and not date of passing of the intimation. The assessee received the computation sheet only in the month of June **** for the first time. Infect the intimation u/s ***(*(a) was never shared with assessee . This can be supported by the online status on Income Tax Site under Return Filed Portal  which is showing the  status as ITR FILED and not as ITR PROCESSED.  Therefor the letter  submitted prior to this dates were having the subject  Request To Issue  Refund and letter filed thereafter was having the subject Rectification Of Mistake U/S ***. It can also be observed that If the intimation was passed in **** itself then why part refund of Rs. *****/- due as per ***(*) computation was released after ** years in July **** only. Further the asseessee would like to draw the attention on the fact that the AO never bothered to reply or reject the rectification application filed earlier. Only after filing the CPGRAM AO suddenly after so many years rejected the application.     The assessee hereby again request to kindly look into the matter and get the order rectified and get the refund released.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,09-04-19,ADDL CIT 3 1,Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax 3 1 1, The grievance is filed in the case of Dopublicity Media Pvt.
