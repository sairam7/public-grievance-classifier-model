AYUSH/E/2019/00336  ,Siub : Complaint against Mis behavior by Mr Jagdeep at CGHS Kingsway CampDear SirThis my *nd complaint regarding gross inefficiency and unacceptable rude behaviors of staff at CGHS dispensary Kingsway Camp. On my *st complaint made to CGHS Director no action was taken   hence staff is at their full zeal to keep on threatening  misbehaving with public at large*. Today morning I approached the registration counter for taking appointment about my son and myself for Ayurveda consultation. The person on duty was Jagdeep. *. I was carrying color print out of online cards available at CGHS website which clearly mentioned that these cards are acceptable  ( I have recently lost my cards so due to urgency i took print out of card and presented at the counter) *. Jagdeep refused to accept these cards and threw it back to me stating that these are not acceptable and on explaining him the situation he said  You could be  fraudster .. he asked me to explain who signed these cards.. why he should accept this. I explained him the website remarks on which he started mis behaving and said  GO TO THE CGHS DIRECTOR WHO SIGNED THESE CRDS AND ASK HIM TO CALL ME ...ASK HIM TO GIVE ME SCANNER *ST USING WHICH I CAN READ  UR  ON CARD ETE ETC .  His tone and words were humiliating .  He even said take my name  Jagdeep  and do complaint to HO..I know how to manage them  . .......i kept on saying that my son is not well and he should accept these cards but he kept on  behaving arrogantly  mis behaved in front of public who was in line . Finally after repeated round of request he accepted but commented   you are a fraudster and threw back cards to me *.  I brought the incident to knowledge of CMO Mrs Bali  who just said   ill look into the matter .  I was expecting at least she should have taken some action or even summoned the concerned person but nothing happened. It seems that we are at mercy of CGHS staff and the way they behave is something which is beyond comprehension . We are not paying for the facility to face such things from the staff... I immediate demand action on my complaint and strict action should be initiated against the erring staff mentioned in my complaint. How can public servant use such humiliating  derogating remarks against public and can ignore his official duties.  Also I demand detailed report on my *st complaint and what action was taken against erring staff at that time It seems until unless CGHS HO department take concrete action these episodes would continue to happen,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,31-05-19,CGHS Delhi,CGHS Office East Zone,  Please look into the matter.,12

AYUSH/E/2019/00338  ,Dear Sir I would like to draw your kind attention towards CURSE being born by BAMS degree holders (prior to **** batch) of Delhi University. Criteria to get first division in all courses in entire country is ** percent while it is ** percent only in case of BAMS degree holders from Delhi University. So person who got even above ** percent is considered as second division (copy attached). After **** amendment this criteria for getting first division has been revised but only for those who are passing out after **** (copy attached). So those who passed out before **** are still bearing the pain as in many recruitment processes first degree plays an important role which can be seen in Delhi University adhoc panel recruitment (copy attached).Secondly BAMS degree does not come under any classification viz Science Commerce Arts Medicine Engineering etc. I hope you will look into the matter as persons from same college and same university cannot have different divisions for same marks.

AYUSH/E/2019/00486  ,Respected Minister of the concerned department  I want to discuss with you the INEQUALITIES FACED BY FEMALE DEFENCE ASPIRANTS IN THE SELECTION PROCESS I m SURBHI SHARMA  one of the defence aspirants from Pathankot Punjab. I have a sorted dream of joining Indian Army for Officer Entry. I appeared for CDS examination conducted by UPSC cleared it got recommended from SSB and was declared medically fit. I have cleared the Exam SSB and the Medical criteria from **SSB Allahbad **** June Inspite of scoring AIR ** I am not able to go to OTA due to less number of vacancies for females. Service Selection Board recommends a candidate since he/she possess all the qualities to become an Army officer and can serve the nation in the best possible way however its the female candidates who are restricted by the LESS NUMBER OF VACANCIES FOR WOMEN CDS ENTRY i.e ** as compared to that of Men vacancies i.e ***. The ratio of ***:** is the issue which has to be looked upon. Sirtoday the Govt of India in all aspects talks of EQUALITYBETI BACHAO - BETI PADHAO and efforts beings made to empower girls but this seems unreal for us because looking at the ratio of ***:** we feel our capabilities and potentials are not even treated equally. We all Men and Women appear for the same CDS examclears the same SSB interview and undergo same medical procedure but when it comes to selection we are  given a tag of MERIT OUT and that too after we see our names in the same merit list of men because in our case only ** girls go to the academy whereas in men case around **-*** seats remain vacant every year and when we ask a reason for this unjust treatment we are  often sympathised by saying girls cant be in Combat roles  sir then why we see girls serving on borders in Central Armed Police ForceBSFthey are posted in naxal affected areas also.And if not the combat roles WE CAN FILL THE GAPS OF LEFT OVER VACANCIES OF MEN CDS ENTRY taking over administrative posts. The women of today have all the potentials and abilities to stand and compete equally with men but if the system itself is not letting us then sorry to say sir we are already failed much before we think of dreaming something big. I dont know how to console myself and my parents in this situation as I never have failed at any level in this process. The boys get a number of opportunities after their schooling like NDA then IMA OTA but we girls only get one entry i.e OTA and that too not really in favour. Not asking for sympathyjust asking for  If there is Equal criteria equal obligations then why are the OUTCOMES UNEQUAL  Sirwhy are we girls of today being encouraged to keep passion towards this service when we are let down everytime by the system itself whenever we come upto the expectations of it. SirI m folding my hands and requesting you that we have not failed at any level in this process please dont let the system fail us due to GENDER INEQUALITY.I humbly request you to take all the girls who are in the merit this time who are medically fit and give us a true example of Women Empowerment.We see many lady officers leading the whole regiment on Republic day parades is where we see ourselves one day so that we can also inspire the coming generation. We know the value of this servicethe integritythe level of loyalty and Dedication it needswe are readyWE ARE READY TO SERVE THE NATION in all kind of terrain. Today in this erawhenever any common citizen of India face any problemwe often hear such words MODI JI KO BOLO WO PAKKA KUCH KRENGE  Sirwe are looking at your with hopeful eyes and our issue be resolved.

My mother is suffering from a lung related disease (Pulmonary Edema) & under treatment at CGHS empanelled hospital Primus Super specialty Hospital-Chankyapuri. On dated **/**/**** while she was taking consultation with the treating doctor she fainted down  & having chest pain & short breathlessness . The treating doctor immediately sent to the emergency of the same hospital where vitals were checked (BP-***/***SiO*-** percent).Seeing the seriousness of my mothers condition the doctor in emergency  immediately admitted her in cardiac care unit (CCU) in emergency &  mentioned complaint of ACS/ DOE/ Ped edema  in emergency certificate. In CCU unit my mother was administered medicine for hypertension & possible heart problem related . In addition to this some pathological test (CBCLFTKFT etc) & radio-logical test (X-Ray chest & *D echo)  in CCU was also carried out. The senior cardiologist of the hospital also suggested for coronary angiography  on  the next day (i.e. dated **/**/****). The angiography confirmed blockage in lung arteries & of non CAD type hence advised not to perform angioplasty  due to her old age (** Years) & advised to kept her on medicine to desolve the mild blockage.

When I asked the reason the dealing assistant told me that the reimbursed amount is restricted to only the package charge of coronary angiography.

Also clarify that if any patient admitted in emergency & if she is being discharged suppose one or two week  after the date of admission then the patient is reimbursed only the package rate of angiography & other charges is to beard by the patient itself.

Till the submission of said letter the assessee has not received any intimation or any refund for the said year.

After filing the letter the assessee followed up with AO and his inspector for the first time shared the online computation working u/s ***(*)  in the month of June ****  showing  non credit of TDS of Rs. ***** /- and refund of Rs.*****.

Irrespective of filing so many letters  till the date of filing the CPGRAM no response has been  received from the learned AO. Being thus aggrieved the asseessee filed the Grievance which was immediately rejected by the AO on the ground that the rectification is time barred and the grievance filed is misleading. In response to this the assessee submits that for calculating the period of * years date of receipt is to be considered and not date of passing of the intimation. The assessee received the computation sheet only in the month of June **** for the first time. Infect the intimation u/s ***(*(a) was never shared with assessee .

CBODT/E/2019/07212  ,Grievance Status for registration number : CBODT/E/****/*****The above grievance has been closed with the following note. Department response: The assessing officer has reported that all pending rectification applications have been disposed off.  In some of the years the rectification applications have been rejected. If the applicant is aggrieved with the orders it can approach the CIT (A). Since all actions at our level have been disposed the grievance is treated as settled.The nature of the response by the department suggests they have hardly any time to address our pending matter which is lying for years. The officer has now pulled up the same old story providing the scanned documents downloaded from the site and backing up their argument in favour of the closure. Time and again we have clarified our requirement in person and submitted detailed calculation showing where the department has gone wrong. This is ridiculous that after tribunal order the effect giving is still pending and the officer is saying everything is closed. The department is claiming rectification petitions have been rejected. But the same have never been communicated to us. We could have appealed against the rejection if the rejection memo was made available to us. All our claims are factually and legally correct. We have provided a detailed year wise dossier besides meeting the officer concerned several times in the past explaining the rectification of order in respect of our matter and also consequential refund which are still pending. Each time we met the officer assured that necessary rectification would be done at the earliest. We have been intimated in the last month that another officer has been entrusted with the task to close all our old matters. The officer called us up and requested to be present at his office for clarifying few points. We requested him to go through our dossier first which was submitted to the ACIT Mr Sandeep Ahuja **(*)/(*)  Aayakar Bhawan Mumbai. After few days when we called him up again to know the status he confirmed he has got the dossier he will study the content and shall revert to us at the earliest in case of any further requirement.

The assessee had filed the return of income for this asstt year claiming deduction for Taxes withheld on earnings in New Zealand for that year against the tax liability on his earnings for the year from within and outside India. The Assessee is an Ordinarily Resident Indian. On **.**.**** the department raised a demand on the assessee by not allowing the deduction for taxes withheld outside India. The assessee filed several responses claiming rectification of the error on *.*.**** and again on *.**.**** praying the department to rectify the demand raised and issue the refund claimed for that year. However there was no action from the department on the matter. Instead the department adjusted the refunds of subsequent years against such demand. After adjusting the refunds of subsequent years the department also raised an interest demand on the original demand and further adjusted refunds of subsequent years against this interest demand. I met the department officials several times in the matter and also raised grievances and disputes against the demand on the Income tax e-filing portal but there has been no positive action from the department and the CPC in this matter. I got to understand from the department officials that the original records of return of income for that year have been misplaced and at the request of the department officials I re-submitted copies of the records and return of income for AY ****-** twice (on **.*.**** and *.*.****) so that the department could verify the return of income once again. However till date there has been no resolution of this matter and the assessee continues to suffer loss due to the above.

CBODT/E/2019/07244  ,I am serving in Border Security Force and presently posted at Calcutta. Having faced continued apathy and indifferent attitude of Income Tax department in release of my legitimate Refund I am forced to submit my second grievance on this portal. My earlier grievance vied Registration No. C.B.O.D.T/E/****/***** dated **/**/**** may be referred. My Income Tax return for A.Y. **** -** had Refund claim of Rs.*****/- which has been withheld by Income Tax Department stating that it is proposed to adjust my aforesaid refund towards D.I.N ********* ********** dated ** Oct **** for the amount Rs.***** including interest raised by the Jurisdictional A.O. as outstanding Tax demand for the A.Y ****-**. As Income Tax due for A.Y. ****-** has been already deducted by my employer as T.D.S I kept on repeatedly approaching my department as well as authorities of Income Tax Department to take appropriate action and release my refund to save me from financial hardship. When nothing worked in my favor I submitted my C.P.G.R.A.M grievance dated **/**/**** quoted above. Thankfully the C.P.G.R.A.M grievance was closed by Income Tax Department on **/**/**** stating that credit of T.D.S for Rs.*****/- was allowed manually after carried out rectification u/s *** of the Income Tax Act **** dated **-**-**** and demand was reduced to NIL for the A.Y. ****-**. Hence the C.P.G.R.A.M stands fully Disposed off. Although this grievance was closed as fully disposed off I did not get my refund for A.Y ****-**. After waiting for more than a month I submitted my grievance dated **/**/**** on e-portal of Income Tax Department. Ironically this grievance too was disposed of stating that C.P.C is unable to release refund and it will be released by jurisdictional A.O. When I contacted authorities at C.P.C Bengaluru as well as Jurisdictional A.O each one of them did nothing but to shirk their responsibility by holding the other one responsible for release of refund. To my utter dismay my refund is yet to be released and I am still facing financial hardship. Hence I am forced to submit this fresh C.P.G.R.A.M. I humbly request that authorities concerned may kindly be directed to look into grievance of this soldier of the nation sympathetically so as to release my pending refund of excess T D S amounting to Rs. *****/- at the earliest so that an honest taxpayer is not made to suffer for his honesty due to inaction of public authorities.

The assessee has given several letters to the income tax department to resolve the issue but no action has been taken since last * years. copy of letter enclosed. In light of above we would request your honour to take neccessary action and direct the authorities to vacate the demand at the earliest. copy of letters  enclosed.The above grievance was closed without providing an opportunity of hearing. Hence this grievance:-The ITO Ward - **(*) Kolkata had stated in his letter dated **.**.**** that on the basis of documents submitted along with rectification petition filed u/s *** of the I. T. Act **** that the mistake is not apparent from record and requires further verification and interpretation.The response given by ITO Ward - **(*) Kolkata is very casual and vague given the facts of the case. Along with the rectification petition and several reminders we have filed the hard copy of income tax return and xml file which were downloaded from the incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in portal. On perusal of the same it is apparent that the assessee company had rightly filed its income tax return. Further in order to verify the correctness of the Long Term Capital Gain (without STT) claimed by the assessee company various notices were issued by the Ld. ITO and in response to the said notices replies along with relevant documents were filed (on **.**.**** **.**.**** **.**.**** and **.**.****). Further arguments were placed at the time of filing the said documents and the Ld. ITO expressed his satisfaction and assured us that the matter would be resolved. Thereafter several visits were made requesting the Ld. ITO for earlier disposal however he delayed the matter by stating that he was preoccupied with other administrative work.The Ld. ITO had stated something about section code. As far as income tax act and return are concerned the assessee company had correctly claimed the Long Term Capital Gain (without STT) amount in the income tax return and is as per the provisions of Income Tax Act. Further the Income Tax Act nowhere states about the section code and it is supposed for internal purpose of the Income Tax Department and Income Tax System. Therefore we fail to understand why the assessee should be concerned about the section code as long as the claim made by the assessee company is correct and the heads of income are correctly filled.

CBODT/E/2019/07506  ,This grievance on behalf of our client Shilpi Sharma with PAN AXOPS****B. She received a query from her Assessing Officer in end of Aug **** to explain a difference of INR **** when comparing data in Form **AS against data in filed return for AY ****-**. Her salary as per form **AS was higher by INR **** as compared to filed return. She approached us in start of Sep **** to help her with answering this query. On analysing we found that the difference was because Form **AS salary amount did not consider the Profession Tax deduction of INR **** which she had claimed while filing her return. This is a legitimate deduction allowed under sec **(*) of the Income Tax Act. And this is very normal - many employers report gross amount without deducting Profession Tax as Salary while filing their TDS returns. Frankly they are within their rights to say that they had credited the amount and then deducted Profession Tax from it. Now in filing TDS returns employers are asked to show Amount paid/credited and not Amount of Salary Income. Obviously this difference is bound to occur. We responded to the query of the AO immediately. However few days back our client Shilpi Sharma informed us that she has been asked to pay INR **** as a demand for AY ****-**. The demand was raised under sec ***(*). On analysing this we found that the demand was solely attributable to that difference of INR **** which we had already explained earlier. On further investigation we found that the AO had not even looked at the response provided by us. Status of our response was - Submitted. It wasnt considered at all. This is unacceptable. We immediately raised a rectification request and raised an e Nivaran request on ** March ****. We asked the AO to respond by today * April ****. Since he hasnt responded we are raising this grievance on behalf of our client Shilpi Sharma. We cannot wait because we are sure that AO will not even look at what we have written to him and what documents have we provided. In absence of any preventive action from our end he might initiate totally frivolous recovery proceedings. This is clear case of Tax Terrorism. We can relate this to the diktat issued to each AO to recover as much money from txpayers as possible since there is a major shortfall in recovery. While we do understand that the CBDT order would be well intentioned it surely does not mean that honest taxpayers should be falsely harassed. This is clear violation of law when a taxpayer is not allowed to claim legitimate deductions and asked to pay taxes purely based on amounts as per Form **AS. And the AO does not even read the response to his query that we give. Under which section is it mentioned that income as per Form **AS will be taken as final. If that is so why are even taxpayers required to file returns. Simply take the Form **AS amount recover taxes and thats it. No deductions allowed nothing. Our client is anyways paying large amounts of taxes. Even for AY ****-** she paid almost *.* lakhs in taxes. Stillthe AO is after her to harass her mentally with this terror or tax laws. We suspect that the AO thinks that since our client is willingly paying taxes she will pay some more too very easily and he could achieve his target easily. At the same time he wont be required to spend efforts in recovering taxes from genuine evaders. This is typical of AOs in Pune. They might think that there is all Techie crowd in Pune no one will challenge him. But they do not know that tax practitioners are around for this very purpose - to call out their bluff. Request you to look into this matter on a priority and save our client from undue harassment. If at all she deserves recognition for paying taxes without claiming too many legitimate deductions. Let us set a good example. Let us not dissuade honest taxpayers by harassing them for paying more and more taxes. We demand a compensation for our client of INR ***** and a quick closure of this matter.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,17-05-19,DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INCOME TAX (SYSTEM),Commissioner of Income Tax CPC ITR,  Please examine the matter and take appropriate action for the redressal of the grievance and upload the final status report at the earliest.,932

These persons will declare their lavish farm-houses as agricultural land even though these farm-houses are in fact used as lavish resorts for week-ends and holding parties. Booster-pumps installed to fill swimming-pools in farm-houses will be declared as means of irrigation.Only some basic amount should be exempted as tax-free agricultural income so that only really deserving small farmers may be kept out of Income Tax provisions.

In fact two  person who protested were beaten by his Goons mercilessly almost to death hence those poor People living near village Bhaidi. After grabbing their lands Ranvir Singh Constructed Bunglow misusing Gov Funds of Village Panchayat approx. Rs. ** Laks. Few People made Complaint but local Police & administration is bribed and made silent and till date no action Not even FIR Registered.ii)Benamy Property Act : Wealth in form of Lands worth Crores of Rs at Village Chhacchu Bigha Rajgir Nalanda Deoghar (Jharkhand) in name of his wife Married daughters. In order to divert black money during Demonetization Constructed School with name Sai International (www.srisainathschool.com) at village More. Having *-* trucks three cars property worth crores etc. All this in just last * to * years without any job business or agricultures.iii) Wealth above income: Ranvir Singh main source of income has been Bank ATMs Fraud and Fake advertisement at katrisarai. Unfortunately almost ** of youngsters from Villages are doing this dirty job under his umbrella. Then illegal Sand-mining forgery of certificates for Teachers Job are his regular income in Laks / Month but Local Police are given monthly commission of Laks who protect him at all time.iv)Corruption : Since time he has been elected to Village Samiti and presently Jila Parishad (Katrisarai Block) Nalanda Bihar the entire Fund (in tune of about Rs.* crores in last * years) coming from Central or Bihar Government is being misused by him for his personnel benefit house and school construction. He submitted False affidavit during his election. v) Land grabbing : He has grabbed almost all the available Public/ Garmazarua Land that were left by ancestors for public use such as Irrigation Canal Lakes even did not left mortuary / Samshan Ghat (** ekars of Land) and now only * or * ekar left south outskirt of village Chaachhu Bigha & Bhaidi etc. Local Circle officer (Katrisaria and P.S.) aware and Complaint given several times but no action till date.Criminal Records : Ranvir Singh has many criminal Records against him for destroying Peace and Law order in which two villages had severe tension and life threat. He was in judicial custody for more than an year or so he was again caught with Narcotics/ Drugs (Ganza) at Kolkata and after bail disappeared several cases under Arms and threat to Life and Property to others are under trial before the Nalanda at Biharshariff Civil Court Nalanda Bihar. Sir since the matter is of grievous nature and it is certain that Local villagers are always in fearful from him hence Independent Judicial Inquiry by a sitting Judge OR Magisterial Inquiry under supervision of Court would be most appropriate and once he is taken into Judicial Custody and brought to Delhi like a place  from where he cannot influence the witnesses many villagers will come forward and support as witness.I expect confidentiality of my name and not to be revealed out.With regards.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,16-04-19,Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax),COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX-INVESTIGATION," ** दिनों की समय सीमा के भीतर शिकायत का निवारण किया जाना चाहिए। यदि इसे हल करने में अधिक समय लग सकता है तो शिकायत पर एक कार्यवाही रिपोर्ट सीपीजीआरएएमएस पोर्टल पर अपलोड की जानी चाहिए और देरी के कारण के साथ अंतरिम उत्तर याचिकाकर्ता को भेजा जाना चाहिए। कृपया शिकायत के निवारण पर दस्तावेजी सबूत के साथ अंतिम रिपोर्ट अपलोड करें।	 The grievance should be redressed within the time limit of ** days.

CBODT/E/2019/07672  ,Hello I had applied for PAN card correction for my name by **-Jan-** and made the payment online. Later I had submitted the form along with proof in UTI office but they have missed my proof and sent the application. Upon checking the status I came to know PAN processing is withheld I then sent an email to the customer care mentioned. They had requested me to send the proofs over email. I sent the documents but they where mailing the same reply again and again also were requesting to send my fathers proof too I sent that as well but the same response from them to send the proof in-spite of my reply. Later someone asked to send gazetted proof. I called the number that was provided in the mail agent kept me on hold for more than **min on the call (agent wasnt clear on the process and kept me hold several times) and while I was inquiring after the call resumed the connection got disconnected. I was unable to contact that number after that they werent also not bothered to ring back again to address my issue. Every time when I send a mail simply they have created a ticket and actioned nothing on it.  Several times I had sent the proof over email. I even requested them to atleast print the card with details that are already present as I have already made the payment but they dint mind responding that as well. Also I had asked the refund incase if they cant do any I got a reply that it cannot be refunded. I have sent so many mails they just kept creating the tickets.

Also kind attention has to be given to the Budget memorandum of Finance Bill **** wherein on page ** it has been stated that (In order to provide clarity in this regard it is proposed to further amend section **A so as to provide for further condition that - the person in receipt of the income chargeable to income-tax shall furnish the return of income within the time allowed under section *** of the Act. These amendments are clarificatory in nature.)Therefore even belated returns filed u/s ***(*) are eligible for exemption u/s **. Further the memorandum itself states that the amendments are clarificatory in nature which clearly means that there should be no change in the position of law. for all the previous years too exemptions u/s ** (except for exemption u/s **(*)) were allowed for returns in Form ITR-* filed belated. Hence there should be no change in the position of law.It is important to realise that most of trust are spending more than ** percent of the income earned by them. If such expense is not allowed it will create an absurd situation where the expense actually made by the Trust is not allowed under the garb of misinterpretation of law and ** percent of tax is levied on the total income of the Trust creating huge demands where in fact all the income has been applied for objects of the Trust.  The same is going to increase the litigation and costs attached thereto. It is a humble request to take active note of the situation and take proper interpretation of the law within the spirit of law and justice and suitable instructions be issued to the CPC for processing of the ITR accordingly.

CBODT/E/2019/07892  ,My PAN No. is APHPS****L. The income tax department has issued me a BRONZE certificate of Appreciation for AY ****-** for my contribution to the nation building.This GRIEVANCE is pertaining to my  IT return for AY ****-**. I have received intimation u/s ***(*) Reference No. CPC/****/A*/********** advising me to pay an additional amount of Rs. ****/- as tax for AY ****-**On perusing the intimation I found that the CPC has not considered in their computation an amount of Rs. ****/- towards Tax relief U/s Sec **/**A. I had considered this amount in my return ( Copy of my IT return form attached ) and filed the same . The additional tax demand is only on account of this amount not being considered by the CPC.I have raised my grievance twice with CPC to rectify the error. However to my surprise both times I have been told that the system has done the computation correctly and I need to file a rectification in the portal. I understand from the helpdesk CPC that this would require me to download the blank ITR file for AY ****-** again from the Income tax website fill all the details again and generate the XML file which I have to upload during rectification. I have also escalated my grievance to the Income Tax Ombudsman  Karnataka vide my emails dated *th April **** and **th April ****. However I have not received any response. Hence I am forced to lodge this public grievance complaint online Sir I beg to inform you that filing of IT return form once is in itself a herculean task for an ordinary Income tax assesse like me. I have done my returns diligently and correctly as required and the same can be checked in the attached file which was uploaded at the time of return. The correctness of my return is also established by the fact that the amount of my Aggregate tax and interest liability in the acknowledgement issued by IT website at the time of my filing of return is Rs. ******/- whereas as mentioned in the Intimation under Sec *** is Rs. ******/-. This points to some error in the CPC software used for generating the Intimation.The CPC and Income Tax Department ( CBDT ) cannot hold the taxpayer like me responsible for any errors in their software utility and ask me to do it for the *nd time for no fault of mine and this is completely unjustified. Request you to kindly look into this issue and advise the Principal Commissioner income Tax department and the CPC to rectify the error and withdraw the additional tax demand.

CBODT/E/2019/07916  ,Dear SirI had raised a complaint vide reference number CBODT/E/****/***** and again raised it via reference number CBODT/E/****/*****. My grievance was that my PAN was allotted to one more person who was having same name fathers name and date of birth.

We also managed to contact him and he asked us to take whatever action we want to take and clearly denied to take any step from his side.I am really worried as his actions are impacting my CIBIL report and I am facing challenges in my financial transactions due to low CIBIL score because of his mistakes.May I request you to look into this and if required permit me to apply for a new PAN card and provide me a letter with these facts which I can submit to all financial institutions to update my PAN.When that person is not responding we need to find out an alternate and I need your help into that.Expecting a quick response and copying below my previous grievance and your kind response on that.Thanks and Best RegardsVijay Pal SinghThe Palwal Co-Operative Sugar MillPalwal HaryanaMobile: **********,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,20-05-19,Commissioner of Income Tax KARNAL,Panipat Range Panipat, Please look into the matter and take action immediately.,1488

CBODT/E/2019/07920  ,Please refer to my earlier complainst and let me make it very clear that it is not a policy matter. It is a complaint against erring CBDT deliberately to harass tax payers so please do not write arrelevant answers and close the matter. If CBDT has so much problems with Public let CBDT be out of preview of Pgportal even otherwise for CBDT rule of land do not apply.Now  with hman assets of CBDT  CPC system ahs also gone in Indian democratic way and acting as a perfect democratic parrot. All applications filed under sec *** for claiming credits of taxes paid after filing of returns and appearing in **AS have been rejected and demand raised. How it happens even almighty does not know.Worse enough even credit granted in earlier rectifications have been withdrawn in current rectifications. It can happen in India only as it is administered by a genius called CBDT.The CBDT should form an outside SIT to investigate all rectifications carried out on **.**.**** and tell peopel what they are doing. For a months default CBDT is sending prosecution notices and what about defaults of their own.It is a specific complaint against rectifications carried out on **.**.**** and taxpayer expect CBDT to start thinking about taxpayers right to get credit of taxes paid. If CBDT thinks it otherwise they should publish a press note telling  tax payers that CBDT will not grant credit for taxes paid. In a country lke ndia it is matter of great shame that tax payers have to go from here to there to get credit of taxes paid. What a great standard. Just writing it  is a policy matter doe snot solve any problems. We want problems to be solved anot a babus excuse. excuses are tehre for courts and CBDT not for tax payers.

Consequent to the amendment to that section income of Cochin port Trust became taxable from AY ****-**. From AY ****-**  to AY ****-** the return of Cochin port trust were filed as a Local Authority. However at the time of filing its return online for the FY ****-** it was noted that there was a mismatch error stating that the PAN does not correspond to the Local Authority Status due to switching over of the E-filing procedure of Income Tax Department from FY ****-** the PAN with which we were filing the returns prior to FY ****-** were not accepting our e filing for the AY ****-** due to the FIRM status of the PAN whereas Cochin Port Trust had the LOCAL AUTHORITY Status. Hence we acquired new PAN as mentioned above and requested the Deputy Director of income Tax -Systems Kochi vide our letter dated **.**.**** (attached) to migrate all the data relating to old PAN to new PAN so as to facilitate the filing of Return for AY ****-** onwards with the new PAN. Accordingly return for AY ****-** was filed under new PAN. However since old PAN was prevailing during AY ****-** the TDS  was deducted by the customers under old PAN AADFC****E amounting to Rs *.** crores. This TDS was claimed by the port in its return for the AY ****-** however the same was not allowed as refund which is pending till today. During AY ****-** and AY ****-** also few customers deducted TDS under old PAN amounting to Rs ******* and Rs ****** respectively  which were  also not refunded though the Assessments were completed.The matter regarding non refund due to shifting to e filing was brought to the notice of Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax Non Corporate Circle-*(*) Kochi vide our letter dated **.**.**** (attached)and then to the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax Non Corporate Circle-*(*) Range-* Kochi vide letter dated **.**.**** (attached).As suggested by ACIT Non Corporate Circle -*(*) Range * we had requested the major customers to revise their TDS Return for the relevant year by giving new PAN of Cochin Port Trust. However no customer has given a favourable response to our request as the Certificate u/s *** was issued under old PAN.

CBODT/E/2019/07970  ,I have a very bad experience with SBI LIFe Insurance and will not advise any retired person to invest in SBI LIFE otherwise one will lose his or her savings after retirement .My wife took two policies for * and *.* lakhs after her retirement in year **** . Insurance cover was *.** per cent and  was told that after * years you can surrender the policy and  one will get back Principal and interest which will be income tax free. Since it contained a word Insurance so I believed them. Now I surrendered these two policies on **/*/**** and received RS ******* including principal and interest.The worst part of the story is that the entire sum received is taxable including  Principal and  interest accrued.Since her total amount come under ** percent slab so she has to pay income tax both on principal amount on which she had already paid income tax while in service. When I contacted SBI LIFE  they beat about bush. I have also lodged a complaint with IRDA and do not hope get any relief. My conclusion is that retired people should not be taken in by the bait thrown by SBILIFE to trap the honest taxpayer govt employees . They have many clauses by which they will eat up your even principal amount on which you have already paid income tax. I have deposited more than * lakhs in last week of March **** after receipt of amount from SBI LiFe. They pay hefty commission to agent to rope in retired employees .   My question is why should I pay Income tax again on the savings on which I had pad tax during my service period.

The refund was occurred in ITR due to TDS credit available for Rs. ******/- in **AS at the time of filing of ITR.

The assessee second time filed the rectification vide acknowledgement no. *************** dated **-**-**** with his request to allow TDS as it was available in Form **AS since filing of original return. However the CPC Bangalore again passed the order u/s *** by not allowing TDS credit citing the following reason Rectification u/s.*** of the Income Tax Act has not altered/partially altered the demand raised u/s.***(*) as there is a variance in the tax credits claimed & allowed. This variance is due to non availability ofTDS credit which is on account of ---Invalid TAN is entered in the TDS Schedule OR--Incorrect details of amount and the year of tax deduction filled in the TDS scheduleOR--TDS Schedule/Tax Paid Schedule not filled properly--TDS is wrongly entered as Advance tax/Self Assessment Tax in TAX PAID Schedule--TDS is allowed to the extent claimed in the TAX PAID Schedule:--Please RE-ENTER all the entries in the schedule i.e TDS on salary/TDS other than salary. All the rectified entries as well as other entries mentioned in the ITR filed earlier are to be entered so as toget full credit.--If the tax payments claimed are not available in your account/Form **AS please get the same corrected by the bank/deductor and get the corrected data uploaded to OLTAS/NSDL database and then file an online rectification request.Note: The assessee is required to file an online rectification request after logging in at http://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in by opening the e-filing tab therein and selecting the taxpayer is correcting the data in rectification under the rectification request type. The assessee should then tick the appropriate box therein for selecting the rectification reason and then upload the rectification XML after making the necessary corrections in the requisite schedules.I would like to say you that none of the above reason is correct. Further TDS credit is available in Form **AS since the day original return is filed. Further all the entries in ITR are completely and correctly posted and all these entries are matching with entries of Form **AS. Then why TDS credit remains unmatched by CPC Bangalore in processing of original return as well as rectification order.

CBODT/E/2019/08076  ,With reference to our earlier grievance in this regard we would like to state that the learned assessing officer has took all the flimsy grounds in passing the rectification order  under section *** of the Act.  The below mentioned are the few grounds which were taken wrongly by the learned assessing officer while passing the order under section *** of the Act. *. Appointed Date: **/**/**** but in the rectification order mentioned **.**.*****. Merger Order delivered on **/**/**** whereas in the rectification order is taken on **.**.*****. Even if a single opportunity of being heard is not provided to us.*. Since the income of both the merged companies are already assessed with M/s Shashimangal Holdings Private Limited than the ITD System of department is not allowing to pass the credit of advance tax paid and TDS deducted under the PAN of Merged company can not be a ground to dispose the rectification petition filed under section *** of the Act.*. Since both the merged companies and assessee company has already filed their ROI upon receipt of Amalgamation Order from high court the learning assessing officer can not take a stand in rectification order  that the assessee should not have filed separate return originally.  Right of filing the revised return was provided by the statute. Further It was held in many judicial decisions that the revised return substitutes to the original return and  upon filing of revised return all the further proceeding should be done on revised return and original return shall be ignored. *. Further The learned assessing officer has taken the ground that when the order of amalgamation was issued on **.**.**** then why the assessee has filed separate returns originally. In this regard we would like to state that the order of high court was delivered on **.**.**** (it is clearly mentioned on high court order) and due to time constant (Due date of filing was **.**.****) the assessee company for the time being has filed separate return and revised its all return once all the compliance requirement of amalgamation was  met by the companies.In view of the above it can be seen that the learned assessing officer was merely in hurry to dispose the grievance and has passed the rectification order which is totally inconsiderable. In this regard we pray before Additional Commissioner/ CIT of jurisdiction assessing officer to look into matter and not to do unnecessary hardship  to file a CIT Appeal for taking only TDS Credit and Advance Tax Credit.

The last fortnight has seen a series of raids by IT authorities on leaders of political parties ministers in non-BJP state governments businessmen associated with these parties and key aides of chief ministers and ministers in non-BJP state governments.Such IT raids have taken place against JD(S)- Congress ministers and leaders in Karnataka TDP leaders and ministers in Andhra Pradesh an important DMK leader and treasurer of the party in Tamil Nadu and some former aides of the Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath.What is noteworthy is that these raids have taken place after the notification of the Lok Sabha election. When the election process is on it is the Election Commission which is in charge of ensuring a level playing field for political parties and the conduct of a free and fair election.In an electoral system which is enveloped by the deployment of vast amounts of money by candidates and parties it is no ones argument that the use of illegal money should not be curbed. But it is the Election Commission which is tasked with this job. The election machinery under the Commission has been trying though inadequately to check the flow of cash for elections. It conducts searches and seizes unaccounted money in cash and hands them over to the IT authorities for further investigation.But the Modi government bypassing the Election Commission has deployed the IT department and the Central Board of Direct Taxes to selectively target political parties fighting the BJP in the elections. The IT authorities seem to find only non-BJP political leaders and ministers to target for suspected unaccounted money. So far not a single leader or business supporter of the BJP nor its allies have been subjected to raids during the election process.These raids serve a two-fold purpose  to dry up the money flow for the election purposes of these parties and opposition candidates and to tar them with the brush of being corrupt and tax evaders.  In contrast it burnishes the image of Modi as a corruption-buster. Modi was quick to use these raids in the campaign trail. In speeches he has referred to how bundles of money have been found in the houses of bade log.The Election Commission has had a weak response to this misuse of the IT department. It sent a letter to the union revenue secretary in which it stated strongly advise that all enforcement actions during the election period - should be distinctively neutral impartial and non-discriminatory. It also said that chief electoral officers must be kept suitably informed about any suspected use of illegal money in the polls.  The EC should have told the union government that no raid can be conducted on political leaders without its express permission. It is not a matter of suitably informing the chief electoral officer but of getting prior clearance to do so.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,22-04-19,Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax),COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX-INVESTIGATION, The grievance should be redressed within the time limit of ** days.

CBODT/E/2019/08086  ,IN election season when political parties are seen to be making promises that would involve a commitment to governments making expenditures later a question is often posed whether the country can afford such a burden. Those who pick this specific criticism among the several possible reasons that could be advanced against what is being offered of course are not in favour of any significant stepping up of public expenditures and effectively assume that the resources that the government can command are not amenable to increase. However Indias tax GDP ratio (central and state taxes combined) has been stuck at around ** per cent of GDP for a long time  which is extremely low by international standards. Moreover two-thirds of the revenues come from indirect taxes in complete contrast to the more common pattern of heavy reliance on direct taxes associated with a high tax GDP ratio. Of course most Indians do not have incomes high enough to pay direct taxes. That if any is however even more of a reason for why revenues should depend less on indirect taxes which tend to make the tax structure regressive. Moreover the evidence clearly indicates that direct tax revenues in India are far below the potential.For the financial year ****-** (assessment year ****-**) the last year for which such figures have been released by the Income Tax Department at least *.** crore entities filed returns with the income-tax department through which they reported an aggregate annual income of Rs **.** crores. Of these entities almost *.** crores (or **.* per cent of the total) were individuals  making up only *.* per cent of the Indian population and representing for sure less than a sixth of all households in the country. Among the rest HUFs filed **.** lakhs of the returns while firms and companies accounted for **.** lakhs and *.** lakhs respectively.The reported income of Rs **.** crores was equal to almost ** per cent of the aggregate national income of the country in that year. This being the share of only the declared income it provides an indication of how large the base for direct taxation in India actually is despite low representation of the populace in it. The tax liability on this income in ****-** was however just *.** lakh crores or *.* per cent of the national income. The quantum of the declared income in one year alone itself being more than two and a half times the total currency with the public also shows how ridiculous was the assumption underlying the note ban that which was announced in the second half of that same year.The case for not levying a higher tax burden on the incomes of those filing returns becomes even weaker when we consider the distribution of the income within them. Highly skewed distributions characterise these whether we look at business incomes or salary incomes  the two main sources which account for **.* and **.* per cent respectively of the total declared income.Business incomes were earned and reported in ****-** by all the different types of entities  some *.** crores in number. More than *.** crore individuals did not report any business income while *.** crores did not report any salary income  in other words there was very little overlap between salary earners and those earning incomes from business activities. However almost ** per cent of the business incomes were reported not by individuals (or HUFs and firms) but by the *.** lakh companies. A mere *** within them accounted for a whopping **.* per cent of this business income of all companies or nearly ** per cent of all business income. Another *** earned **.* per cent of all company business income or *.* per cent of the total. Thus less than **** companies out of *.** lakhs (or *.** per cent of them) accounted for over ** per cent of company profits and ** per cent of all incomes from business. This represents a very high level of concentration of business earnings.Please see the attached PDF File for more details.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,16-04-19,Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax),CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX  CHENNAI," ** दिनों की समय सीमा के भीतर शिकायत का निवारण किया जाना चाहिए। यदि इसे हल करने में अधिक समय लग सकता है तो शिकायत पर एक कार्यवाही रिपोर्ट सीपीजीआरएएमएस पोर्टल पर अपलोड की जानी चाहिए और देरी के कारण के साथ अंतरिम उत्तर याचिकाकर्ता को भेजा जाना चाहिए। कृपया शिकायत के निवारण पर दस्तावेजी सबूत के साथ अंतिम रिपोर्ट अपलोड करें।	 The grievance should be redressed within the time limit of ** days.

CBODT/E/2019/08434  , श्रीमान जी मेरा नाम संदीप खत्री है मैं पंजाब का रहने वाला है एक नागरिक हूं । अपनी इस शिकायत में मैं आपको हमारे शहर डेराबस्सी में बने कुछ नाजायज बिल्डिंग और उन पर लगे हुए काले धन के बारे में  सूचित करना चाहता हूं कि हमारे शहर में एक होटल जिसका नाम होटल ब्लू सफायर  ( Hotel Blue Sapphire ) है । यह होटल पूरी तरह से काले धन के स्त्रोत का एक उपयुक्त उदाहरण है  । यह बिल्डिंग प्रमोद जैन और संजीव जैन जो हमारे शहर डेराबस्सी के ही रहने वाले है । उनके द्वारा इसके इलावा एक एयर होटल जिदक नाम होटल ज्योति ( Hotel Jyoti ) है यह भी काले धन का एक उपयुक्त उदाहरण है ।होटल ब्लू सफायर  इस बिल्डिंग को बनाने में तकरीबन * से * करोड रुपए खर्च किए गए हैं । यह तीन से चार करोड पर पूरी तरह से काला धन है जो कि इस बिल्डिंग पर लगाए गए । मेरे द्वारा उपयुक्त समय पर संबंधित कार्यालयों और नगर निगम को लिखित शिकायत दी गई लेकिन प्रमोद जैन और संजीव जैन के रसूख के कारण पैसा  फेंक कर शिकायत  पर किसी तरह की कार्रवाई ना करने के लिए कहा गया । यह होटल पूरी तरह से गैरकानूनी रूप से बना हुआ है  ना तो इस होटल के पास किसी तरह का ही कोई लाइसेंस ही है ना ही किसी भी संबंधित डिपार्टमेंट की कोई क्लीयरेंस ही है और ना ही इस होटल के पास बिल्डिंग परमिट है । और ना ही अन्य किसी सरकारी संस्था का कोई क्लीयरेंस सर्टिफिकेट या अप्रूवल ही है  ।इन सब के बावजूद भी मेरे द्वारा संबंधित कार्यालय एयर नगर निगम में शिकायत दर्ज कराने के बाद किसी तरह की कोई कारवाई नहीं  हुई । मेरे द्वारा हमारे शहर डेराबस्सी की माननीय एसडीएम साहिबा श्री मति पूजा स्याल ग्रेवाल जी के पास लिखित में शिकायत दर्ज करवाई गई  परंतु अभी तक वहां से भी इस तरह की कोई ठोस कार्यवाही नहीं की गई । इन सब के बीच में मुझे हमारे लोकल थाना सिटी डेराबस्सी में एस एच ओ  श्री विक्रमजीत सिंह घुम्मन ( SHO VIKRAMJIT SINGH GHUMANN ) के द्वारा मुझे बुलाकर  एक झूठी शिकायत के आधार पर मुझे डराने धमकाने की कोशिश की गई । मुझसे कहा गया कि मैं संबंधित शिकायतें वापस ले लो और जो बिल्डिंग बन रही है उसकी तरफ कोई ध्यान ना दूं और ना ही किसी तरह की कोई शिकायत  आगे से  करें  नहीं तो मुझे झूठे केस में फंसा दिया जाएगा और मेरे परिवार के ऊपर भी इसी तरह का दोष लगा कर उनको भी फंसाने की धमकी दी गई  । श्रीमान जी यह होटल पूरी तरह से काले धन से बना हुआ होटल है जिसमें कि ना तो किसी संस्था से कोई लोन या कर्ज ही  लिया गया है और ना ही इस होटल के पास इसके निर्माण को लेकर किसी तरह का कोई  उपयुक्त बिल या हिसाब है । ना ही यह पैसा कहां से आया तीन से चार करोड़ रुपए जो होटल  पर लगाए गए उनका स्त्रोत भी कागजों में कहीं नहीं है । इसी होटल के मालिक का दूसरा होटल जिसका नाम की होटल ज्योति है वह भी काले धन का एक बहुत बड़ा स्त्रोत है । सब तरह के गलत काम करवाए जाते हैं यहां पर जुआ खेला जाता है यहां पर औरतों के साथ होने वाले गलत काम हर तरह के अन्य गलत काम भी किए जाते हैं । परंतु यह प्रशासन को पता होने के बावजूद भी किसी तरह का कोई ठोस कार्रवाई नहीं की जाती । मेरी आपसे गुजारिश है कि आप जल्द से जल्द इस होटल पर के काले धन के स्त्रोत का पता लगाएं और जमा करवाएं और निष्पक्ष होकर कानूनी कार्रवाई करें। आप जी से उचित कार्यवाही की उम्मीद करता हूँ ।संदीप खत्तरी ,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,22-04-19,Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax),COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX-INVESTIGATION," ** दिनों की समय सीमा के भीतर शिकायत का निवारण किया जाना चाहिए। यदि इसे हल करने में अधिक समय लग सकता है तो शिकायत पर एक कार्यवाही रिपोर्ट सीपीजीआरएएमएस पोर्टल पर अपलोड की जानी चाहिए और देरी के कारण के साथ अंतरिम उत्तर याचिकाकर्ता को भेजा जाना चाहिए। कृपया शिकायत के निवारण पर दस्तावेजी सबूत के साथ अंतिम रिपोर्ट अपलोड करें।	/	 The grievance should be redressed within the time limit of ** days.

CBODT/E/2019/08502  ,Sir/MadamSubject:- Builder deducted TDS of ** lakhs but deposited only a part with IT dept. without linking to PANI am writing this on behalf of my father Mr. Mohinder Singh (PAN: ABDPS****A) who is in his mid-eighties. He is a citizen of India and lives with me in Canada.In Oct **** acting as an attorney for my father I sold his property to a builder Mr. Sanjeev Jhanji (TAN: DELS*****C) for about Rs. ** lakhs. Mr. Jhanji deducted a tax of about Rs. ** lakhs and promised to deposit it within a month with the IT dept.  This is clearly stated in the sale deed (see PP* of attached file).However after a lot of follow-up and effort he made a deposit of about ** lakhs (including education cess and penalties) in Feb of **** but did not link that payment with PAN of my father. This means we have zero proof that TDS was paid. He cannot be communicated with any longer. In addition to the mental anguish this has caused other problems for us.*. We cannot validate Indian and Canadian ITRs. My CA filed the Indian ITR for my father but has expressed his inability to verify it due to lack of proof of TDS payment. This means that we do not have Indian IT assessment. The sale of a house being a major financial transaction  the capital gains on it has to be declared not only in India but as a Canadian resident also in Canada. The Canadian law requires one to declare his/her worldwide income. However the Canadian IT dept. has refused to accept the ITR in the absence of an assessment from India and have levied penalties on us.*. HDFC my bank in India has refused to allow us to repatriate the sales proceeds on grounds that we did not pay the TDS. But we did. We are fully compliant with the law. We paid the taxes that were asked for. It is Mr. Jhanji whose non-compliance is causing these issues. We are unable to understand why the bank should withhold our lawfully acquired funds.I request you to take action against Mr. Jhanji  who is sitting on money belonging to the Treasury for about *.* years. The entire episode has caused considerable anguish and suffering for my ageing father. He would like to properly file Indian and Canadian IT returns as well as see his hard-earned money in his possession.Thanking youSincerelyJaspreet Singh JodhkaMy PAN: BHXPJ****RMy father: Mr. Mohinder SinghHis PAN: PAN: ABDPS****AProperty in question:*** Double Storey New Rajinder Nagar New Delhi *** *** India.Builder: Mr. Sanjeev Jhanji KPMJ Constructions N-* Ground Floor Kirti Nagar New Delhi *** *** India.His TAN: DELS*****C.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,25-04-19,Jt.

The grievance was closed requesting the tax payer to pre-validate the bank account on the income tax efiling portal. However upon logging in into the e-filing portal it is observed that the Mobile Number (as per the bank account records) is a mandatory field. However the tax payer is a non-resident and registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as a Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) in India. The only activity in which the tax payer is involved is purchase and sale of securities in India and does not carry in any other business activity. Thus it does not have any Permanent Establishment (PE) in India. Accordingly they do not have any telephonic details in India that can be provided. Also at the time of account opening with the custodian in India no mobile number has been provided. Further as we understand the refunds are processed electronically therefore there is ideally no requirement for the mobile number to be provided in this respect. Therefore we request you to either do away with the Mandatory Mobile Number requirement or provide us with an alternative solution to pre-validate the bank account at the earliest.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,23-04-19,DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INCOME TAX (SYSTEM),Commissioner of Income Tax CPC ITR, Please examine the matter and take appropriate action for the redressal of the grievance and upload the final status report at the earliest.,2402

CBODT/E/2019/08624  ,Dear SirPlease find below the details of my grievance.*. I was an employee in M/s Rotodyne Engineering Services (P) Ltd. a company having its office in Chandanagar Hyderabad ****** from **.**.**** to **.**.****. I was appointed as General Manager (Business Development) vide Appointment letter dated **.**.****. I was paid a monthly salary of Rs. *****/-*. My salary of April **** was paid on **.**.**** which was transferred to my bank account. There was a deduction of Rs. ****/- towards TDS as per payslip issued to me. The company is supposed to deposit this amount in Govt. Account and issue me TDS Certificate / Form **. I was told that the TDS certificate would be issued to me at the end of the financial year. However even after regular follow up for the said TDS certificate personally through mails and messages I was not issued. Similarly TDS of Rs. ***/- and Rs. ***/- was deducted in my October and November **** salaries also for which no TDS certificate was issued to me.*. On *.*.**** while I was in my seat and working in the office I was suddenly asked to leave the office by Mr. P. Rangareddy the Executive Director of the company without stating any reason. My repeated requests asking for reasons for this sudden removal was not answered and I was pushed out of the office by force. On asking for my pending salary other dues and notice period salary I was told that the same would be settled shortly and transferred to my bank account. *. After that I continuously followed up for my salary dues and TDS certificate but there was no response from the company. I did not received TDS certificate / Form ** for the year ****-** even after **st March ****. I sent many mails but was not successful in getting my dues and Form **.*. I then got issued a legal notice to the Managing Director M/s. Rotodyne Engineering Services (P) Ltd. through my advocate on **.**.**** but the notice returned un-served with postal department remarks REFUSED.  The company refused to take delivery of the cover.*. After I was sure that any further followup or waiting will be of no use I filed a complaint with the Income Tax department TDS wing on **.**.****. The TDS Wing asked for their explanation but the company gave a false statement saying that there was a clerical error in the payslip and the deduction of Rs. ****/- is towards recovery amount of Salary Advance. To support their statement they submitted a fabricated Debit Voucher for Rs. ****/- to the department. *. I made several visits to the ITO TDS Ward *(*) Hyderabad at your AC Guards office and personally explained all the facts and showed the documents in support of my statements that the voucher is fabricated. I also clarified the matter through a letter dated **.**.**** to the IT Department and enclosing all the relevant documents in support of my submissions but the concerned officials did not feel it necessary to investigate the matter or verify the original documents / voucher and closed my complaint based on the submissions of the company. However they advised me to approach the concerned authorities who deals in cases of forgery and fraud. Hence finding that the company is getting away in this way after cheating the IT Department I thought of bringing the matter to the notice of the higher authorities of Income Tax through CPGRAMS. I look forward for suitable investigation by the department in this matter.The disputed voucher and letters sent to me by the Dept. is enclosed herewith.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,30-04-19,CIT TDS HYDERABAD,JCIT2, The complaint may be examined and the report may be submitted at the earliest.,2404

CBODT/E/2019/08874  ,This is in reference to the notice received u/s ***(*) by me dated * April **** in respect of my income tax return filed for  FY ****-**** (AY ****-**) vide acknowledgment number *************** on ** August **** stating the said return to be defective in nature.The notice specifies the reason for defect in the tax return filed as credit for TDS claimed but the corresponding receipts /income has been omitted to be offered for taxation. In this regard I wish to state that during the FY ****-** as per the Form ** and **AS my then employer Pricewaterhouse Coopers Private Limited (PwC) has specified the salary amount paid to my account as INR ********/- and had deducted a TDS of INR *******/- on the above stated salary. Thus as per my Form ** I was due for a receipt of INR ********/- as net salary incomeAs part of the policy of PwC only part of the salary pertaining to a particular year is disbursed in cash  during the previous year and the balance is retained / held back by them - to be paid at a future date while full taxes are deducted at source on the total annual salary. During the subsequent financial year (FY **-**) I decided to leave PwC and pursue other career opportunities. In that case as per their policy and internal processes PwC forfeited the portion of the salary pertaining to FY ****-**** that was held back by them (while TDS was deducted thereon and deposited with the Central Treasury). In effect for FY ****-**** PwC had paid an amount of salary of INR **** *** (post deduction of taxes) to my bank account as against the sum of INR ********/- (as per Form **). In this regard while filing my return for FY ****-** I declared a salary income of INR *******/- post grossing up the actual receipt with the taxes thereon. Net Salary of INR **** *** as received from PwC can be validated from my bank statements.Given the above mismatch in the salary amount identified by the system I have received the above notice for filing of defective return. In view of the above facts I have laid down the concept of real income under the ITA through quoting relevant case laws in the attached letter. Thus basis the said cases I would like to state that in my present case given the excess income of INR *******/- (i.e. INR ********/- minus INR *******/-) is not real and is not due as there is no realisation of benefit in a realistic and practical point of view. Therefore the same should not form part of my salary incomePlease note in response to the above notice received I have filed my revised income tax return with the real salary income accrued and received by me as stated in the original return.Thus I request if you can consider the above submission along with the return filed in response to the captioned notice u/s ***(*) of the Act. You would appreciate that I suffered great hardship and lost substantial monetary benefit due to leaving PwC. Thus would request that the said refund as claimed in the original return and subsequently in the revised return filed pursuant to the notice issued u/s ***(*) be processed immediately. If you may so desire please get my bank account scrutinized through  respective Assessing Officer (AO) in order to verify any facts and seek further details as may be appropriate to process the said refund.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,26-04-19,DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INCOME TAX (SYSTEM),Commissioner of Income Tax CPC ITR, Please examine the matter and take appropriate action for the redressal of the grievance and upload the final status report at the earliest.,2781

CBODT/E/2019/08883  ,Dear Sir This is in relation to unnecessary hold back of my refund for Assessment Year ****-** amounting to INR ******* determined as per intimation under section ***(*) issued by Income-tax department dated **th Feb ****. This is due to lack of action at CPC Banglore of giving effect to an order passed income-tax officer in relation to one of the earlier assessment years.The refund for the assessment year ****-** was held back in the pretext of erroneous outstanding demand of INR ******* for Assessment year ****-**. This erroneous demand was brought to the notice of income-tax department and was rectified by income-tax officer - Mr Joseph Rodrigues (Dy Commissioner of Income-tax **(*) Mumbai) via order dated **th March ****. In this order issued by the income-tax department the demand was reduced to meager amount of INR **/- (copy of order attached below for ready reference). Consequently the outstanding demand on the website should have reflected the effect of the aforesaid order and the refund for AY ****-** should have been granted to me rightfully.However CPC Banglore who is responsible for giving effect of the income-tax proceeding on the website has not been upto their work causing unnecessary hardship to me. I am getting deprived of the benefit of the refund which rightfully has been granted to me as per Income-tax law due to non-action by CPC Banglore team. Thus I would kindly request CPC banglore to give effect to the order of the income-tax department issued and reflect the position for AY ****-** correctly on website. Further and more importantly grant me the due refund for AY ****-** at the earliest.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,26-04-19,DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INCOME TAX (SYSTEM),Commissioner of Income Tax CPC ITR, Please examine the matter and take appropriate action for the redressal of the grievance and upload the final status report at the earliest.,2800

This is very surprising to note that the issue which was mentioned in grievance was not even entertained and therefore unresolved.

Had our AO not seen the portal today morning even he would not have come to know about this act on part of CPC.This manual order was uploaded in the first week of April **** by the jurisdictional AO and the same was pending for processing at CPC for almost a month. The entire trail is evidenced by the screen hots of the status we have with us. We hope there is an electronic trail which can help you appreciate the facts.

CBODT/E/2019/09059  ,Dear Sir/MadamPlease see the responses received for CBODT/E/****/***** and CBOEC/E/****/*****. (PAN - AIJPG****P)The response received are same for both the grievances and I am afraid that my grievance is not resolved.  I am trying to raise the issue again here with more clarification. The issue is that for AY **** I have already paid tax in Taiwan on my global income which includes salary in India and according to double taxation agreement I was supposed to get the refund of this TDS which is still not processed.The first Notice ***(*)(a) for AY****-** was received on *th May **** and was dated *rd May ****. It was responded on **nd May****. (** days were provided in the notice for the response). Transaction ID is **********.The second Notice ***(*) for AY****-** was received on *st Oct **** and was dated **th September ****. It  was responded on **th Oct ****. Transaction ID is **********.My past grievance have been rejected where it is stated that the response to a notice (for AY ****) was missing. Can you kindly point to me regarding which response was missing. I understand that instead of processing refund additional tax demand is added to the new notice . As a response I have humbly disagreed to the demand and raised a rectification request.  It is a request to refund the hard earned money of the taxpayer which is more than ** percent of my annual income lying with the income tax department for more than two years now. In case any document or proof is required please do let me know. I have hard/soft copies (stamped and verified) for income tax payments in Taiwan as well as Taiwan tax residency certificate available with me. The tax filings and calculations have been handled by Earnst and Young (EY) associates on behalf of myself and MediaTek. Any details on calculations involved can be immediately provided.Best regardsVatsal Gaur,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,29-04-19,DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INCOME TAX (SYSTEM),Commissioner of Income Tax CPC ITR, Please examine the matter and take appropriate action for the redressal of the grievance and upload the final status report at the earliest.,3039

CBODT/E/2019/09076  ,Dear Sir I am a foreing visitor to India and I have had an incident  with a local shop who refused to give me a bill or invoice for the amount Ive paid to them. So far Ive never experienced such an uncomfortable situation before in India and therefore I believe I must let your organization know about this person. The shop where Ive taken my mobile for a repair a few weeks ago is located in road no ** hi-line complex shop **A Banjara Hills the name is MOBILE CARE. So after the technician repaired my mobile which Ive paid **** rupees for the service never gave me a bill or invoice for the paid amount. He claimed that the owner wasnt there and requested me to come back another day. Which I did because the phone stopped working even after it was repaired but this time the owner himself  refused to give me a bill or an invoice for the previous  paid repairing service. I enquired why so and he clearly stated that HE DIDNT WANT TO CHARGE GST.... I said that I didnt mind to pay for taxes because it is an obligation we all must follow and he said that he wont... So I warned him that if he refused to give me a bill or invoice I would go to the authorities and he told me that he didnt care because he KNOWS PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT and that he even payregularly to the local police some side money... I honestly dont believe what he says is true but I do know that these statement s are serious accusations against the government and police. Not only that he is not issuing invoices for the service his employees provide to customers therefore no giving any guarantee for the repairs and not collecting GST for the money he receives. This man is too bold and I think somebody should stop him to keep cheating both the customers and the authorities.

CBODT/E/2019/09147  ,As  the CBDT is well aware that NRI/PIO are not eligible to apply and receive Aadhaar as it is exclusively available to Resident Individuals in India. By definition PAN is a Tax ID number which is mandatory in India and  functional equivalent is available in all countries in the world where a mechanism for income tax exists. Yet CBDT encourages if not mandates invalidation of PAN for not linking Aaadhar. This  prevents  legitimate and legal ways for NRI/PIO to continue to hold and make any investments in India. NRI/PIO has been held at par with Resident Indians and have been encouraged to make investments in India in bank deposits capital markets and real estate. As a matter of fact to the best of my knowledge NRI/PIO have been granted this as a right by the Constitution of India to make such investments and hold such investments in India. By invalidating PAN of NRI/PIO for not linking  Aadhaar CBDT is denying NRI/PIO their constitutional right to make and hold such investments in India.  The enclosed clarification document posted on the Income Tax India e Filing portal from CBDT vaguely mentions exemptions from mandatory requirement for linking Aadhaar to PAN. I feel that this leaves for misinterpretation of CBDT requirement in this regard to various entities such as Banks and PAN processing centers. I believe that a corrected version of enclosed clarification be posted specifically mentioning that NRI/PIO are not required and exempt from linking Aadhaar with PAN and NRI/PIO PAN will remain intact.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,30-04-19,Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax),Joint Secretary Tax Policy and Litigation," ** दिनों की समय सीमा के भीतर शिकायत का निवारण किया जाना चाहिए। यदि इसे हल करने में अधिक समय लग सकता है तो शिकायत पर एक कार्यवाही रिपोर्ट सीपीजीआरएएमएस पोर्टल पर अपलोड की जानी चाहिए और देरी के कारण के साथ अंतरिम उत्तर याचिकाकर्ता को भेजा जाना चाहिए। कृपया शिकायत के निवारण पर दस्तावेजी सबूत के साथ अंतिम रिपोर्ट अपलोड करें।	/	 The grievance should be redressed within the time limit of ** days.

CBODT/E/2019/09148  ,NRI/PIO have been denied access to receive Form **AS through the NSDL site.

Kindly register and access TDSCPC NRI services through same. However the registration process is nearly impossible and with error messages and even if an applicant goes through the entire process of registration and error message appears that the service is not available and please try again.As a result NRI/PIO has to fly blind every tax year as they are not able to reconcile their TDS credits against their tax liabilities and must file their returns without any reconciliation which by contrast is available to all Resident Indian taxpayers.

I am not satisfied with the response given by the Director of Income tax  CPC for the following reasons:*.	In the form ITR- * ( Excel software ) which I have used for filing my return the computation of the Gross and Net tax liability( PART-B-TI-TTI) is done by the Excel software itself. These are white coloured cells where assesse CANNOT enter any figure.    *.	In my ITR Excel utility software which I have used for uploading my returns the Excel Utility/ Software has calculated automatically and arrived at a Gross Tax liability of Rs. ******/- and after deducting the Tax Relief under section **/**A the software has arrived at the Net tax liability of Rs. ******/-. With the addition of Interest of Rs. ***/- the Excel software has arrived at a Total Tax and Interest liability of Rs. ******/-. This is also reflected in the  Income Tax acknowledgement issued by CPC online after filing of my return ( E filing Acknowledgment No. *************** - file attached . PASSWORD TO OPEN FILE IS aphps****l******** )*.	However in the computation sent under Section ***(*) though the Gross tax liability has been rightly mentioned as Rs. ******/- the Net Tax liability is wrongly reflected as Rs. ******/- since this has not considered the Tax relief of Rs. ****/- under section **/**A.*.	My request to the Director of Income Tax  CPC based on my above statements is to consider the above points and provide me a reply to the following query :a.	As claimed by CPC If I have not entered the amount of Rs. ****/- as Tax relief under section **/**A in my ITR return why does the Income Tax Return acknowledgement ( E filing Acknowledgment No. *************** - file attached ) show a Net Tax Payable  of Rs. ******/-b.	Without the tax relief amount under section **/**A the return software should have calculated the Net tax Payable amount as Rs. ******/- (and NOT Rs. ******/- ) and the same should have been reflected in the IT return Acknowledgment . WHY DID THIS NOT HAPPEN*.	The fact that the IT Return acknowledgement also mentions the Net tax Payable as Rs. ******/- this is ADEQUATE PROOF to show that I have indeed considered Rs. ****/- as Tax relief under section **/**A. Hence the contention of Director of Income Tax  CPC that I have not considered the amount of Rs. ****/- in my return is INCORRECT. My request to the Public Grievance Officer / Director of Income tax CPC is ONCE again as follows:*.	The Income tax department should accept complete responsibility for any error/BUG in their  software and take necessary corrective action at their end instead of penalizing me by advising me to file rectification return since I have proved beyond doubt that all figures including the tax relief figures under section **/**A have been entered by me in the IT return form ITR-*. *.	Request the Director of Income Tax CPC to withdraw the additional tax demand and send me the revised and correct intimation under section ***(*) instead of asking me to file a rectification return.",TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,30-04-19,DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INCOME TAX (SYSTEM),Commissioner of Income Tax CPC ITR, Please examine the matter and take appropriate action for the redressal of the grievance and upload the final status report at the earliest.,3250

Kindly refer to my form **AS for the financial year **** ** (copy enclosed). It shows my wrong address. It is the address of my last unit I served while in the Army. My present address after my retirement from my Army service on ** Nov ** is E *** Ganga Vihar Extension Sadullabad Loni Ghaziabad ****** hence I complained vide my grievance No. PMOPG/E/****/******* dated ** Mar ** (copy enclosed) to update my address in my income tax records.  In response I was advised through a phone call from phone No. *********** of Income Tax department to correct my address first in my PAN card and then the same would be updated in my income tax records.  So I started to correct my address in my PAN online through UTIITS website (its print shot attached).  The application was being processed successfully by the system up to online payment of the required fee and I made online payment also of Rs **.** (extract from my related extract from my bank statement enclosed).   Thereafter the system processed my my application successfully a few step further but could not process the same successfully to its end due to some unknown error hence I could not get my required coupon No. for that.  I complained the matter giving all my particulars and related details to the UTIITS email ID utiitsl.gsd(at)utiitsl.com (copy enclosed) but got nether solution (copy of related UTIITS email attached ) nor satisfactory response. Online pan correction system is faulty in itself as it not only processes the application unsuccessfully due to its own inbuilt fault but does not refund the fee paid also in that case.  The applicants like me are unnecessarily harassed by not providing their corrected PAN card even after making payment of the required fee for none of their fault.  This is shameful and not new for the govt. sites including this.  The private telecom service providers automatically refunds the amount involved in case of failure in successful processing of the application but in my case I am being provided neither solution to my problem nor refund of my paid fee.  So it is earnestly requested that either my application should be processed rectifying fault in the process and I should be given the required coupon No. for further follow up or I should be refunded my paid fee.  System must be rectified also to avoid recurrence of such incidents in future,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,02-05-19,DIRECTOR GENERAL OF INCOME TAX (SYSTEM),Director of Income Tax (Systems)-I, Please examine the matter and take appropriate action for the redressal of the grievance and upload the final status report at the earliest.,3560

CBODT/E/2019/09438  ,Dear Sir / Madam:I am a registered valuer of plant and machinery under section **AB of income tax act and got my registration after lot of scrutiny by the Income Tax department. Recently I went to the website of Income Tax department to see the eligibility criteria for becoming a registered valuer under section **AB of Income Tax act and realized that the criteria has been relaxed or diluted to a great extent than what was it earlier. This can lead to people coming into this profession without any proper knowledge skills and experience and create havoc and putting more stress on already crumpling banks under NPA loans.To make my point I would like to draw your attention to Rule No. *A of Wealth Tax Rules ****. It states:A valuer of immovable property (other than agricultural lands plantations forests mines and quarries) shall have the following qualifications namely :-(i)  he must-     (A)  be a graduate in civil engineering architecture or town planning of a recognised university or     (B)  be a post-graduate in valuation of real estate from a recognised university orWhen I searched on internet about graduation program in valuation there is no such course running in India either approved by University Grants Commission (UGC) or All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE). Since there is no graduation course in valuation how can universities run post graduate course in valuation. Again these post graduate courses in valuation are not approved by UGC or AICTE. For such unapproved courses how can government department like income tax consider as a criteria. Also in many high courts including Punjab and Haryana high court the above post graduate course in valuation has been challenged and the universities offering those courses as well as UGC have been made opposite party.Sir /Madam another aspect of this course is I am attaching herewith the admission criteria of one of the colleges (iStar College affiliated to Sardar Patel University Gujarat). This criteria states that the candidate should have Bachelor Degree Examination preferably in commerce science engineering architecture mathematics statistics economics law management and agricultural science of this University or an examination recognized as equivalent thereto.In case of Annamalai university it mentions that a computer science engineer can also become their real estate / plant and machinery valuer. I fail to understand as to what valuation work of land and building or plant and machinery a computer engineer can do.Sir / Madam we engineers slog for at least ** years to become chartered engineer and then start carrying out valuation and then get registered with income tax department whereas people who pass out BA (economics) or BCom fresh from college can become registered valuer. Since they have no practical knowledge of say  of plant and machinery / building how can they estimate the value. This can lead to very rough or sometimes unrealistic values the plant and machinery / building causing bank to approve loans on this faulty valuation causing major loss to the nation as most the loans are disbursed by PSU banks.Also earlier the valuer had to show minimum income of Rs. ***** in * out of * financial years. Now it has been diluted to Rs. ***** in * out of * years. Sir / Madam with cost of living increasing and inflation coming into picture the income criteria should increase and should not decrease. So I request you to please increase that annual income criteria to Rs. * Lakh per annum in * out of * years.Considering all the above I request you to please amend the rules so that only good quality valuers come into profession and carry out for the area for which they have got their graduation done (mechanical / electrical / marine / aeronautical engineers carrying out plant and machinery valuation and civil engineers / architect carrying out land and building valuations).Warm RegardsC.

I had raised an E-Nivaran grievance with the Income Tax Department on **-**-**** but it was closed subsequently saying that intimation u/s ***(*) of the Income Tax Act would be sent by mail once the processing is completed.

As is provided in *** (*) the assesse can revise the Return filed us ***(*) within one year of end of relevant assessment year or completion of assessment whichever is earlier. Thus the Revised Return was filed within the prescribed time period ie within one year of completion of relevant assessment year.In the computation of income submitted along with the Original Return filed by the company it has disclosed Other Income to the extent of Rs. *******. This amount should have been reduced from the book profit for computing income taxable under the head Income from Business and Profession. However while filing the tax return the assesse erroneously increased the Business Income by Rs ******* instead of reducing it. The same resulted in double taxation of Rs. *******.We subsequently noticed the error and revised the return on **th December **** in which only change was reduction of Rs. ******* from income under the head Income from Business or Profession instead of increase as was done earlier. The case was selected for scrutiny. Order us *** * was passed on **.**.**** assessing the income of the assesse at Rs********. However the Order us *** (*) has been passed on the basis of Original Return without considering the Revised Return filed by the assesse.

But refund puts on hold because Bank details of Legal heir not registered with the portal. 		When we applied for the Legal heir of Late. Prakashchandra Dave there was no such option available which ask for the Bank details of Legal heir.  Now at present there is option available for the bank details of legal heir. So we had made an application to CPC - Bangalore explaining the situation. They reply that Contact your Jurisdictional Assessing Officer for the validating that Assessee Mrs. Smita Dave is legal heir of Prakashchandra Dave  		Based on the Communication received from the CPC-Banglore we make an application at Local Jurisdictional Assessing Officer on **th March-****. But after ** days they demand like TDS Certificate and Salary Certificate with reasons that we have to check the correctness of refund. So we have also submitted the all document they required. But still there is no proper response received from the local officer.  	Later on we also filed Grievance against this issue to Assessing Officer (ITO/ACIT) or Supervisory Hierarchy regarding refund still not issue. But we facing shook while receiving the reply against such Grievance which indicate that Credit for TDS given and demand reduced to Nil. Hence grievance treated as solved. The department had treated as Nil order passed without any Demand or Refund and without any prior intimation to us as there is refund of Rs. ******. And when we visit at Income Tax office they reply that our system is not working and like that.Now my question is that why they are not release our refund as the order also passed by the CPC Bangalore and still the local office demands the documents as they have only verify whether Mrs. Smita Dave is legal heir of Late. Prakashchandra Dave or not based on letter received from the CPC Bangalore and Jurisdictional Officer passed the order as Nil.So we request you to help us so that we can get the refund along with the interest till date. As on one hand if Department want tax they collect the interest upto date when we make the payment then why not they give refund with interest till date of issue rather than date of order passed.Thanks and RegardsSmita Prakaschandra DaveWith this reply here we had attached the following documents for your reference* Death Certificate of Prakashchandra Dave* Legal Hair Documents ( LIC Pension Plan Latter & Pedhi Namu)* Status of Legal Heir on Income Tax Portal.* Salary Certificate from GSFC* Income Tax Return Filed for A.Y. ****-**.* Intimation order with Refund u/s ***(*) from CPC - Banglore* Letter from CPC  Banglore * Letter to Local Income Tax Officer.* Grievance Letter Filed** Grievance Resolution Letter Received",TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,20-05-19,PR.COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX VADODARA 4 VADODARA,RANGE 4.1 VADODARA, Kindly take action and upload the final status report at the earliest.,4362

If the Income-tax department has doubt on my honesty and integrity I suggest them to raid my house.  I am an honest gazetted officer who has paid all taxes on time.

CBODT/E/2019/10020  ,Assessee is a non-resident Company and is assessed to tax under the jurisdiction of DCIT CIRCLE INT TAX *(*)(*) D Civic Centre New Delhi under PAN AAMCA****A. The assessee has received intimations u/s ***(*) of the Income Tax Act **** determining refund along with interest u/s ***A payable for A.Y. ****-** vide communication reference no. CPC/****/A*/********** of Rs. ****** for A.Y. ****-** vide communication reference No. CPC/****/A*/********** of Rs. ******  and for A.Y. ****-**  vide communication reference no. CPC/****/A*/********** of Rs. ******.However the assessee has not received the said refunds till date even though considerable time has elapsed since the said orders were passed and refunds were determined payable.A brief history of the case is stated as under:*. Refund failed to be issued by CPC for the first time due to absence of an Indian bank account to which the refund cheque could be issued. Therefore the assessee opened a bank account in India and reapplied for the refund by filing the relevant documents*. Inspite of opening a bank account in India the refund was not granted by CPC. It was stated that there is no Indian communication address to which the refund cheque could be sent. Therefore the assessee authorized Jitendra Sanghavi & Co. Chartered Accountants a firm in India to receive the refund cheque on their behalf and reapplied for the refund by filing the requisite documents and address details.*. However the refund reissue request was rejected once again stating a mismatch of details between response sheet for reissue and address proof.*. As per the latest e-mail received from CPC the assessee was requested to link their PAN Card with their bank account to which the refund could be issued and to pre-validate the bank account on the Income Tax Portal. The assessees PAN card is already linked to their Indian bank account and the bank account has been pre-validated on the Income Tax Portal.*. The assessee also received communication from CPC requesting to apply online for the refund. Accordingly the assessee filed refund reissue requests online. However the same have been rejected multiple times without citing any reasons.*. As per the latest e-mail received from CPC the refund was rejected due to mismatch in name of the company on the PAN card and companys bank account name. However the name of the company on the PAN card is the same as the bank account name of the company (copy of cheque and PAN Card attached). It can be seen that there is no difference in the name of the assessee at both the places.*. The assessee has also filed multiple grievances with CPC on its portal requesting to issue the refund due to them. However no satisfactory resolution has been provided and the refund has not been issued despite all efforts and documentary compliance as requested by CPC.As can be seen from the above the assessee has been consistently following up with CPC and has provided documents as requested to enable CPC to issue their refund at the earliest.The assessee has made several refund reissue requests and filed grievances to find an appropriate resolution for delay in the reissue of refund. However the refund for the three years as mentioned above has still not been issued.It is therefore requested that the CPC and/or the Assessing Officer may be directed to issue the refund at the earliest.  Also please find attached chronology of communication received from CPC and replies made by the assessee.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,21-05-19,CIT INTERNATIONAL 1 DELHI,INTERNATIONAL TAXATION RANGE 11, Kindly look into the matter and redress the grievance at the earliest.,4422

CBODT/E/2019/10110  ,Respected Modi Ji I JATINDER PAL SINGH am a retired Subedar from Indian Army and have been operating my pension account No. *********** in SBI Sabhapur Delhi. My PAN is BCEPS****D. As my form **AS for the financial year **** ** (copy enclosed) was showing my wrong address I complained vide my grievance No. PMOPG/E/****/******* dated ** Mar ** (copy enclosed for ready reference) to rectify/update my address in my income tax records.  In response I was advised by Mr. Mishra through a phone call from phone No. *********** of Income Tax department for online sending of scanned copies of my PAN and aadhar card to him which I did accordingly (copy of my related email and scanned copy of my PAN/aadhar card enclosed for ready reference).   After that Mr Mishra informed me that my PAN card contains my wrong address hence firstly I have to send online correction application through UTIITSL website for correction of my address and my address in his department records would be updated thereafter.  So I started to correct my address in my PAN online through UTIITSL website.  The application could not be successfully processed even after making online prescribed payment of Rs **.** (related extract from my bank statement enclosed) due to defective website.   Online pan correction system is faulty in itself as it not only processes the application unsuccessfully due to its own inbuilt fault but does not refund the fee paid also in that case.  This is shameful and not new for the govt. websites including this.  The private telecom service providers automatically refund the amount involved in case of failure in successful processing of the application for recharge of the mobile.  Now when I was perusing my old records I found the forwarding letter of my PAN card (enclosed for kind perusal) clearly showing my correct present address ie E *** Ganga Vihar Extension Sadullabad Loni Ghaziabad ****** and then I remembered that I had got my fresh PAN card with my present address after losing my previous one.   As I had filled correct name of myself and my father along with my correct date of birth in the application form for fresh PAN card I was again allotted the same PAN ie BCEPS****D.  In addition my PAN has also been linked to my aadhar No. ************ (relevant extract from the related website also enclosed).  Thus it is now clearly established that such an important department like Income Tax does not maintains its record accurately.  The bureaucrats posted are utmost negligent in performing their duty and do not peruse the matter thoroughly even after receiving the related complaint and disposing it of illogically.  I feel a great shame in my matter but I know very well that none of the bureaucrats/staff of Income Tax office would feel any shame and offer his regret for unnecessary harassing me while resolving such a minor and very simple grievance.  May I still expect that my correct present address would be updated in my income tax records accurately without any further delay and I would be informed thereafter accordingly along with refund of Rs **.** got illegally and illogically paid from me.

Since then it has been highly painful and stressful journey to follow up for the refund and unfortunately for us we have not received the refund even on date. We have been like a football falling in the legs and being kicked by different departments due to miserable miscommunications and lack of accountability and responsibility.We are stuck between the two departments first is CPC bengaluru and second is Assessing officer Ward **(*)(*) Aaykar Bhavan Churchgate Mumbai for the refund. Even writing to grievance at income tax portal has been failed badly in obtaining the refund.Since there is not adequate place to write the detailed sequence of activities till date we have attached the covering letter outlining complete details of our sufferings along with other evidences as single attachment.The brief of our sufferings are as followsThe first party to the issue is CPC bengaluru.*. Once the refund was determined we have continuously followed up with CPC for the receipt of refund*. Over more than *** telephonic calls to get the updates on receipt of refund*. We received different feedbacks for our different calls we could still not understand the reasons for the difference in feedback for or various callsa. Initially they said the refund has been processed and to check on NSDL for further update for refundb. Then they said the refund has been put on hold by the AO and therefore to meet the AO for further redressal c They cannot tell the reasons to us for holding the refund and need to contact AO*. Since it was not clear to AO as well they asked the AO to call on the CPC internal number * They provided ITBA helpline number for internal contact however the same kept on ringing and no * picked the calls and some numbers on ITBA software were out of serviceThe *nd party to the issue is the AOThe AO said he is not aware of any reasons for non release of refund the follow up could be done only with CPC bengaluru.As required by CPC The AO was not aware of any internal number and hence could not resolve the matter as guided by CPC bengaluruEven the PR was not aware of any such internal numberAO and PR said the communication with CPC was very difficult as they would not answer the calls or resolve the tickets raisedThe *rd part of the issue is Grievance redressalWe tried writing the grievance at the Income tax portal regarding the non receipt of refund amountThe resolution provided was PAN not linked to the account so prevalidate the account and request for refund reisuueHowever the pre validation was already done and the mail dated **.**.**** was received confirming the successful pre validation.We could not request for refund reissue as we got the remark that No refund failures to raise refund re issue service request as quoted. The request for refund re issue cannot be done even as on date as CPC has not rejected the refund inspite of their mention in the resolution on **.**.**** so reissue request has not become possibleThus it was grossly irresponsible and unaccountable on CPC to proceed against the grievance and conclude with the right solution.As the events are briefed up for lack of space humble request to check the attachment for detailsThus entire episode and sequence of events are difficult to describe the pressure and pain that we have gone through the entire period.

I also have a copy of the rent agreement signed between Dr. Biswas and me which I am attaching with this complaint report.I attached this rent agreement with the income tax rebate report for this financial year at my workplace and they demanded to know the PAN number of Dr. Biswas to further consider the rebate. I contacted Dr. Biswas to obtain his PAN number stating my reasons but he denied the same in the most humiliating ungentlemanly manner as possible. After several attempts to contact him (also his wife) for the same and enduring episodes of scornful conversation I threatened him that I would file a complaint against him in this matter following which he verbally abused me even more. Dr. Biswas has several such properties that he rents to tenants like me and his unwillingness to produce PAN card when demanded shows that he is involved in tax related frauds perhaps on a bigger level.Following are the details of his residence and contact for further inquiry:Dr. A.

The said grievance was referred to a officer who had earlier closed the matter without going into the details / facts and without verifying the original documents.  I cannot expect a better reply for closure of grievance from the same officer.*. I am repeatedly saying that a voucher was fabricated and a photostat copy of a fabricated voucher was submitted by the company / deductor to the department to support their statement that there was no TDS deduction. I am unable to understand why the original voucher is not being verified by the department.*. It is wrong to say that I worked with the company from April to November **** and my total gross salary during the period did not cross the taxable limit. Hence no recovery towards TDS was made in any of the salaries paid to me.  In fact I worked from **.**.**** to **.**.**** and my monthly salary as per appointment letter is Rs. *****/- which comes to Rs. ******/- for ** months which is very much in taxable limit. The TDS was deducted in my April **** salary which is the *nd month of my service.  How did the company assume in my second month of service that I will be removed shortly and my total payments will not cross the taxable limit. Their statement is totally false. *. Relying on the statement of the company and fabricated voucher submitted by them the grievance is closed where as my statement / submissions have been ignored. *. I have enough evidence to prove that the Pay Slip issued to me is correct wherein there is a TDS deduction made. Also I have enough evidence to prove that the voucher is fabricated. But the concerned officer is totally ignoring my statement and relying on the statement of the company.Hence I request the higher authorities of the department to conduct a detailed verification / investigation for the truth to come out.,TAKEN UP WITH SUBORDINATE ORGANISATION,20-05-19,CIT TDS HYDERABAD,JCIT2, Please look into the issue and submit a report,5053
